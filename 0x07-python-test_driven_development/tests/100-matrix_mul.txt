>>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul

Test regular matrices multiplication:
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
[[7, 10], [15, 22]]
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]])
[[13, 16]]

Test empty matrix:
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
m_a can't be empty
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
m_b can't be empty

Test non-rectangular matrix:
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
each row of m_a must be of the same size
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
each row of m_b must be of the same size

Test invalid elements:
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, '4']], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
m_a should contain only integers or floats
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, '4']])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
m_b should contain only integers or floats

Test invalid types:
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul("not a list", [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
m_a must be a list
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], "not a list")
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
m_b must be a list

Test non-list of lists:
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([1, 2, 3], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
m_a must be a list of lists
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [1, 2, 3, 4])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
m_b must be a list of lists

Test incompatible matrices:
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
m_a and m_b can't be multiplied

Test with missing arguments:
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul([[1, 2]])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
matrix_mul() missing 1 required positional argument: 'm_b'
>>> try:
...     matrix_mul()
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
matrix_mul() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'm_a' and 'm_b'
